# LeaEquipmentLister

An Addon for World of Warcraft Classic which generates a HTML profile page from a character's inventory and currently equipped items.

The HTML is generated inside a multi-line edit box so you can copy and paste it into a text editor of your choice. That edit box can be displayed via `/eqlist`.
